Steps to Clone github files:
    Copy the repository file link (https link) and go vs code open terminal if windows use the command "bash" initially
Commands :
----------

1.git clone "https link"  : git repo will be fetched to particlar location locally
2.ls                      : shows list of files present in the repo
3. ls -a                  : Shows all files including (hidden also)
    by this command we can check whether the repo is having ".git" file or not {without ".git" we cannot connect with git hub}

    If ".git" file is not available in it, Then use init command

4. git init               : inserts ".git" file into repo

5.git status                : To check the status of git

        Status : 4 types 
        i)   Untracked  : for new files that are not present in git hub
        ii)  Modified   : any changes applied in exisisting files
        iii) Staged     : Ready to commit
        iv)  Unmodified : No changes done on files

data modified/ created --->  "git add filename" command (staged) ---> "git commit -m "Some message" (Commit to local Git) " ---> "git push origin main"(to push data from local git to remote) --> refresh github we will see changes


6. git add .                      ---> to add all modified/new files at a time to staged

7. git commit -m"Commit Message"  ---> to save changes permenantly and ready to move to actual DB

8. git push origin main           ---> to throw the data from local to Remote GitHub repo

9. cd ..                         ----> Inorder to make commander to come outside the folder

10. mkdir file name              ---->  (make directory) to create new folder

11. cd File name                 ---->  to enter into File
